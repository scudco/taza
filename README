== DESCRIPTION:

Taza is meant to make acceptance testing more sane for developers(or QA where applicable) and customers.

== FEATURES:

* Generate a project for browser-based testing
* Generate pages and sites for different applications
* Create flows that move through a site
* Use filters to control which elements are accessible on a page depending on its state
* Taza automatically creates and cleans up the browser for each site just like a File block
* Manage tests by tags
* Cross-site testing

== ISSUES:

* Taza has only been used in the wild with WATIR(Safari/Firefox/IE), but Selenium support is built-in
* Taza's generators currently generate RSpec specs, Test::Unit and other test framework support is planned

== SYNOPSIS:

Taza is meant to be a refreshing way to look at browser testing. Taza provides a few ways to abstract browser-based testing into three simple ideas.
  * Sites
  * Pages
  * Flows

Sites have Pages.
Pages have elements and filters.
Flows are common actions on a site such as logging in or performing a search.

Here's an example for starting a project around the Google sites

  $ taza google
  $ cd google/
  $ ./script/generate site google
  $ ./script/generate page home_page google
  $ ./script/generate flow search google
  $ rake spec:isolation:google

That will generate an RSpec HTML report at artifacts/functional/google/index.html
