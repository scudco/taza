Taza is a web application testing framework meant to be used with browsed-based testing libraries like WATIR or Selenium

Not all web applications can be written in Ruby, unfortunately. When you aren't testing an application that was written with testing in mind Taza can provide a structured and opionated way to do browser-based testing.

* Sites have Pages
* Sites have Flows that move through Pages
* Pages have elements and filters to define simple ways of interacting with them
* Pages have tests/specs that help chip away at the dreaded 0% Coverage Beastâ„¢

* Features
  * Generate a Taza project easily
  * Generate Sites, Pages, and Flows using a familiar format(./script/generate)
  * Automatically generate specs when generating a site to push you
  * Easily switch browser and/or driver
  * Automatic opening and cleanup of browser
  * Included rake spec commands generated for sites and pages
  * Rake spec commands will create an RSpec HTML report by default
  * Easily tie-in special functionality like getting a DOM dump of each browser before it closes
